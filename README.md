# adventofsql
Repository for participating in the upcoming Advent of SQL event, which will be live from December 1st on its [website](https://www.adventofsql.com/). I don't yet know what the exact setup of the challenges will be, but I want to be well prepared! PostgresQL (the main target of the event) is a new flavour of SQL for me, so with this initial setup I want to make sure I have the general setup tested and can hit the ground running coming December.

Will you join too? Submit your email adress on the website!
